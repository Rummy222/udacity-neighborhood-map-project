# South Bay Neighborhood Map Project

Developed for Project 5-1 of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.**

Included is a list of my and my friends' favorite restaurants in the South Bay along with some local parks in the area.

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map along with some additional info pulled from Foursquare where available (such as websites and phone numbers, although none of the places listed require a reservation.)

The app is responsive (try it for yourself), resizing using CSS Flexbox and media queries to recalibrate itself based on your screen size.
